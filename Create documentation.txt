Here is the code written with ASP .NET 6:
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Stripe;
using UseCase2.Models;
using UseCase2.Services.Interfaces;

namespace UseCase2.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class StripeController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly IBalanceService _balanceService;
        private readonly IBalanceTransactionService _balanceTransactionService;

        public StripeController(StripeConfigurationOptions stripeConfig, IBalanceService balanceService, IBalanceTransactionService balanceTransactionService)
        {
            StripeConfiguration.ApiKey = stripeConfig.ApiKey;
            _balanceService = balanceService;
            _balanceTransactionService = balanceTransactionService;
        }

        [HttpGet("Balance")]
        public ActionResult<Balance> GetBalance()
        {
            try
            {
                var balance = _balanceService.Get();

                if (balance != null)
                {
                    return Ok(balance);
                }

                return NotFound();
            }
            catch (StripeException ex)
            {
                return StatusCode((int)ex.HttpStatusCode, ex.Message);
            }
        }

        [HttpGet("BalanceTransactions")]
        public ActionResult<StripeBalanceResponse> GetBalanceTransactions(string startingAfter, int? take)
        {
            try
            {
                var options = new BalanceTransactionListOptions
                {
                    Limit = take ?? 10,
                    StartingAfter = startingAfter
                };

                var balanceTransactions = _balanceTransactionService.List(options);

                return new StripeBalanceResponse
                {
                    Status = "Success",
                    Message = "Balance Retrieved",
                    Data = balanceTransactions
                };
            }
            catch (StripeException e)
            {
                return new StripeBalanceResponse
                {
                    Status = "Error",
                    Message = e.Message
                };
            }
        }
    }
}

The project also have Unit Tests to cover test cases for both of the endpoints above.
Unit tests written with XUnit and uses Moq library to mock the data.

Readme for Stripe API Integration with ASP .NET 6
Application Description
The application integrates the Stripe Payment Gateway with an ASP .NET 6 backend, allowing users to access balance details and transaction histories tied to their Stripe accounts. It has been built with robustness in mind, encapsulating the business logic in service classes and using dependency injection for maintainability and testability. The provided endpoints offer access to account balance and transaction lists with adjustable parameters for more specific queries. Exception handling is efficiently implemented to cater to any Stripe-specific errors that might arise during the operation.

This application also ensures that code quality and functionality remain paramount by incorporating Unit Tests. These tests use the XUnit framework in conjunction with the Moq library, ensuring that all possible use cases and edge scenarios are well-covered, providing a safety net against potential bugs and regressions.

Running the Application Locally
Prerequisites: Ensure you have the following installed:

.NET 6 SDK
A suitable IDE like Visual Studio or VS Code
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone [repository-url]
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/project-directory
Restore Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
dotnet restore
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
dotnet run
Your application should now be running locally at http://localhost:5000 (or the port mentioned in the terminal).

Using the Endpoints
Fetch Balance:

URL: http://localhost:5000/api/Stripe/Balance
Method: GET
Description: This endpoint returns the balance details tied to the Stripe account.
Fetch Balance Transactions:

URL: http://localhost:5000/api/Stripe/BalanceTransactions?startingAfter=txn_123456&take=5
Method: GET
Parameters:
startingAfter: The ID of the last transaction on the previous page (used for pagination).
take: Number of transactions to fetch. If not specified, defaults to 10.
Description: This endpoint returns a list of balance transactions with optional parameters for pagination and the number of records.
Always remember to check the application's documentation or codebase for any additional configuration or endpoints. Happy coding!
